### How-to-run

If you are using the scripts I have created (`Makefile` and `start-node.sh`), please the follow these steps.
1. In the `Makefile`, under `run-server`, change the values that follow `cs455.scaling.server.Server` as you wish.
2. Run `make run-server` (I have used port `5600`)
3. Run `sh start-nodes.sh <server-host>` (example: `sh start-nodes albany`)
